**Title: Sentiment Analysis**

Description:
This repository contains Python code for sentiment analysis using both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The sentiment analysis task involves classifying text into categories such as Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Irrelevant. Two different approaches are implemented: 

1. Machine Learning Approach:Utilizing the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization for feature representation.
2. Deep Learning Approach: Implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on word embeddings.


Dependencies:
- pandas: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.
- scikit-learn: For implementing the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and evaluating model performance metrics.
- TensorFlow: For building and training the LSTM neural network model.
- NLTK: For tokenization and text preprocessing.

Usage:
1. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed. If not, install them using pip.
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow nltk
   ```
2. Run the code in the provided Jupyter Notebook `sentiment_ml_dl.ipynb` to perform sentiment analysis on the given datasets.
